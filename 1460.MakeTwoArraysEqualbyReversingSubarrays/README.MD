# Thought Process
I essentially need to check whether or not the arrays are equal to each.
So, I could sort or hashset/table to get the answer.

I found it the easiest to essentially compared the sorted arrays
First reversing arr then sorting makes the speed a little faster
then comparing and returning true vs false.
